I gave a talk on "vibrational control and epileptic modeling" to the [Jan C. Willem Center for Systems and Control](https://www.math.rug.nl/gcsc/members.html) at the University of Groningen. It was a great pleasure to go back to Groningen. Thanks, [Ming](https://www.rug.nl/staff/m.cao/ancillary-activities), for hosting me!
